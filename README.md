This project was originally going to be my first #1gam project
but I became very invested in it and have decided to put my
planned projects for #1gam on hold to work on this more often. 
Technically it is in some passable alpha form but I'd like to 
make this into a fully fledged web game for people to play. 
You can play the most current build at [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~kevinosu/1gam_jan/](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~kevinosu/1gam_jan/)!

- Timing infrastructure. Send to server? lmaooooo
- Better writing design
    - currently the most pressing issue is not accounting for
    "bad" inputs by the user
    - examples:
        - Mei said "Don't tell me" when the roommate said
        "guess what"
        - Mei said "It's all right" and the co-worker responded
        "Good to hear!"
    - take matthewit's suggestion of making the game aware
    - perhaps make the mouse icon change when over
    the floating word?
        - despite reading the instructions it was still
        unclear to linh how to play?
    when you are inputing nonsensical things
- fix query algo
- Change text tweening
	- Make high anxiety move fast, low anxiety move slow (opposite of rn)
	- parametric eqs
	- physics sim? lel
- Intro panes to scenarios 
- ART!!!!!
