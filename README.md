[Eggs for Breakfast](http://kevino-is.me/eggs_for_breakfast/) takes the conventional dialogue system of games and breaks it down further in an attempt to reflect the awkwardness and anxieties of real, natural conversations.

TODO
- Better writing design
    "bad" inputs by the user
    - take matthewit's suggestion of making the game aware
    when you are inputing nonsensical things
	-Make passages more meaningful
	-come up with better inaction/flub dialogue
		- randomize responses? Could be better
- Callback functions for OnLoad and OnSpeak
- Add keyboard controls to delete words, or make a static
delete button. In general fix UI.
    - Add a "backspace" button. Purple maybe?
- fix query algo
- Intro panes to scenarios 
- ART!!!!!
