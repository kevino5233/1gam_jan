This project was originally going to be my first #1gam project
but I became very invested in it and have decided to put my
planned projects for #1gam on hold to work on this more often. 
Technically it is in some passable alpha form but I'd like to 
make this into a fully fledged web game for people to play. 
You can play the most current build at [http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~kevinosu/1gam_jan/](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~kevinosu/1gam_jan/)!
